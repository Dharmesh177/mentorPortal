I've been doing mentoring for a year now or so, and have spoken to many people. But so far, I think Jerry has the most thinking capacity in his upper chamber :D\\n\", '::\\n The mentorship was awesome. Jerry was super professional.\\nMy level of understanding was not easy as I\u2019d just landed in the data science paradigm.\\nBut without any judgment, he gave me clear insights that help me to go further on specific tasks.\\nEven if we hadn\u2019t included in our basic requirements, Jerry had not hesitated to correct my Python\u2019s code.\\nIn every aspect of our exchanges, I could felt the experiences he had from the Silicon Valley. I feel so blessed !\\nAnd for another project, I\u2019ll come back again to Jerry with no hesitation.\\n']",

And he was exceptional at breaking down my experience and framing in a way that showcased my product experience and achievements and really changing the way that I spoke and even thought about my work. His feedback on my LinkedIn generated -no lie- at least 1-2 recruiters cold reaching out to me every single day for weeks. I had 11 interviews in a single week. Really top notch guy and really happy to be working with him. My one critique is that it was a bit challenging to hear back from him sometimes as life circumstances got in the way.\\n']",
